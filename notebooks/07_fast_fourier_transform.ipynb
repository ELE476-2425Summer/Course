    "The previous two notebooks introduced Fourier's Theorem and the DFT. Throughout this notebook, we will investigate a technique that speeds up the computation of the DFT, known as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We will begin by understanding the Danielson-Lanczos Lemma and then implement an FFT design from first principles that will serve as an example. We will briefly explore the Numpy FFT module, before finishing with a short introduction to the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).\n",
