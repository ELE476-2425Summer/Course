    "\n",
    "Digital filters are a key element of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and they are implemented using only Multiply-Add (MAC) operations, and delays. Their role in a DSP system is to attenuate certain bands of frequencies within a signal, while letting the other frequency bands pass through unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main algorithms for digital filters, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR). Typically, FIR filters are preferred for many applications because they are more stable and can easily be constrained to achieve a linear phase response (more on this later). For these reasons, we will concentrate on the design of FIR filters only.\n",

Again, this is usually given in dB, and is measured from the highest peak (sidelobe) in the stopband. The attenuation required can differ greatly dependent on the application, from as little as 20dB for some audio applications, to over 80dB for radio systems. \n",

    "For certain applications, the phase response of a filter is an equally important factor. In general, a filter will change the phase of any signal passing through it. Depending on the filter design, the phase will change by different amounts at different frequencies. And, because a change in phase is a delay in time, it will not affect the magnitude response of a signal, but rather the signal in the time-domain.\n",

If a filter exhibits linear phase it means that the shift in phase, relative to each frequency, changes at a constant rate (i.e linearly). Conversely, for non-linear phase filters the phase shift will not be constant between frequencies, hence distorting the shape of the time-domain signals passing through the filter.\n",

If the error is too large then another guess is made and the algorithm repeats. This goes on until the maximum error has been minimised to an appropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognise this as an optimisation technique, and that is because it is! The benefit of using this type of algorithm is that you have significantly more control over the frequency response than you do with the Window Method, most notably, the transition bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major limitation of this technique though is that it requires convergence (e.g. the error must be continuously minimised). Under certain conditions the error will fluctuate wildly and the algorithm will never find an optimal solution, causing the filter design routine to run ad infinitum. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid this by adding constraints to the algorithm, for instance by setting a maximum number of iterations to compute, but the resultant filter may not be suitable. Another option is to reduce the constraints on the transition bandwidth by making it wider; again, this may result in an undesirable filter. For these reasons it is always best to check the quality of the filter before applying it to your system.\n",
